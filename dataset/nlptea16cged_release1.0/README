1. Directory Structure and Contents
===================================

The top-level directory has three subdirectories, namely

- Evaluation/	: The program used to evaluate the test data sets. 

- Test/	: For the TOCFL track, we have 3,528 testing sentences.
          For the HSK track, we have 3,011 testing sentences. 
					About half of these sentences are correct and do not contain grammatical errors, while the other half include at least one error.
	        participating research teams were allowed to use other public data for system development and implementation.

- Training/	: For the TOCFL track, we provide 10,693 training sentences with a total of 24,492 grammatical errors.
							For the HSK track, we provide 10,071 training sentences with a total of 24,797 grammatical errors.
              Each sentence with annotated grammatical errors and their corresponding corrections is represented in SGML format.
