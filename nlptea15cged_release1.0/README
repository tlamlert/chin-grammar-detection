1. Directory Structure and Contents
===================================

The top-level directory has four subdirectories, namely

- Dry/	: The dryrun set used for output format validation

- Test/	: This set consists of 1,000 testing sentences.
					Half of these sentences contained no grammatical errors, while the other half included a single defined grammatical error: redundant (132 instances), missing (126), selection (110), and disorder (132). 
	        Participants can employ any linguistic and computational resources to identify grammatical errors.
                        
- Tool/	: The program used to evaluate the test data sets.  

- Training/	: This set included 2,205 selected sentences with annotated grammatical errors and their corresponding corrections.
							Each essay is represented in SGML format.
							
		Example:
			<DOC>
			<SENTENCE id="B1-1120">我的中文進步了非常快</SENTENCE> 
			<MISTAKE start_off="7" end_off="7">
			<TYPE>Selection</TYPE> 
			<CORRECTION>我的中文進步得非常快</CORRECTION>
			</MISTAKE>
			</DOC>

  -i : file path of the system results (required)
  -t : file path of the ground truth (required)
  -o : file path of the detailed evaluation report (optional) 
  
Example:   
java -jar nlptea15cged.jar -i NLPTEA15_Toy_Result.txt -t NLPTEA15_Toy_Truth.txt -o NLPTEA15_Toy_Evaluation.txt
